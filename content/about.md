Hi, my name is Thuong Son Tung ‚Äî aka nh0kt1g3r12. I'm a junior college student majoring in Information Security at Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City.

During my time in college, I‚Äôve developed a strong passion for Digital Forensics and Incident Response. My goal is to become a SOC Analyst, Incident Responder, or Threat Hunter.

I'm actively participating in various CTFs and hacking competitions with [f4n_n3r0](https://ctftime.org/team/281734), a team made up entirely of my classmates. We're currently ranked 3rd on the Vietnamese ctftime scoreboard.

I‚Äôm currently seeking an internship opportunity in the U.S., as I‚Äôve recently relocated to Anaheim. If any HR professionals are viewing this, please feel free to contact me using the information provided in my portfolio. Thank you very much!
